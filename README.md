## 🚀 Anushka's Developer Portfolio

This repository hosts the source code for my personal developer portfolio website, designed to showcase my skills, work experience, and personal projects.

### 🎯 Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to serve as a comprehensive, single-page application (SPA) style portfolio to:
1.  **Introduce Myself:** Provide a dynamic and engaging introduction using animated text effects.
2.  **Highlight Experience:** Clearly document my professional journey and timeline (Work Experience section).
3.  **Showcase Capability:** Present examples of my work (Projects section).
4.  **Provide Contact Points:** Offer accessible links for downloading my resume and connecting via LinkedIn.

### ✨ Features

* **Responsive Design:** Ensures a great user experience across various devices.
* **Modern Aesthetic:** Clean and professional layout achieved using HTML and CSS.
* **Dynamic Text Effect:** Utilizes the **Typed.js** library to cycle through key roles (`Web Developer`, `Graphic Designer`, etc.) for a compelling header.
* **Structured Content:** Clear sections for Introduction, Work Experience Timeline, and Projects.
* **Professional Links:** Direct links to my Resume (`AnushkaCV2.pdf`) and LinkedIn profile.

### 🛠️ Technologies Used

| **CSS3** | Styling, layout, color scheme (inline `<style>` block). |

| **Typed.js** | JavaScript library for the dynamic typing animation. |

### 📂 File Structure

### 💻 Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

To view and edit this project, you only need:
* A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
* A text editor (VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.).

#### Local Setup and Run

To run this project locally, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [Your Repository URL]
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd [repository-name]
    ```
3.  **Open in Browser:** Open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser. Since all resources (CSS and JS) are locally linked or loaded from a CDN, no local server is required.

    ```bash
    open index.html
    ```

### 📈 Future Enhancements (To Do)

This section outlines potential features and improvements for future development:
* **Refactor CSS:** Move the inline `<style>` block into a separate external `style.css` file for better code organization and maintenance.
* **Add Projects Content:** Populate the `thirddivision` (Projects section) with actual project cards, descriptions, and links.
* **Responsiveness Optimization:** Improve mobile responsiveness, especially for the horizontal Work Experience timeline.
* **About Page/Section:** Expand the "About" information beyond the first section.
* **Contact Form:** Implement a functional contact form instead of just listing links in the footer.
